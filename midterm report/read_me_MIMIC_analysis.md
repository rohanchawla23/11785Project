# MIMIC-IV analysis script info
This folder contains the 2 python scripts I used and the specific csvs from MIMIC-IV that gave me comparison data for our midterm report. The most important data was other diagnoses for cancer-positive patients.
# CSV files:
Files I created from scripts:

*'cancer patient records.csv': The better cancer-positive patient data csv. Note that some patients have multiple diagnoses of pancreatic cancer.




# Python scripts:
*'analysis.py': My first script for finding the length of datasets (I used an IDE (Pycharm) so explicit running of len(dataset) was unnecessary).
*'analysis2.py': Continuation of the MIMIC subset data from analysis.py. 
# Notes:
* Commented out calculations I already had. Current versions are not stand-alone.
